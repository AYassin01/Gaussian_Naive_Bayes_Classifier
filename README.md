# Gaussian_Naive_Bayes_Classifier
### Implementing Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch and apply it on the numerical data of the popular Iris dataset, assuming all the features follow a normal Gaussian distribution. Then, evaluating the performance of our classification model

Gaussian distribution is a type of probability distribution that is often used in statistics and machine learning. In the context of Naive Bayes, it is used to model the likelihood of a feature given a class label.
